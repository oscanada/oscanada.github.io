The **1st Canadian Conference on Open Science and Open Scholarship** is a landmark national event dedicated to accelerating the adoption of open science practices across the country, making research more accessible, transparent, and collaborative. Hosted by Concordia University and partner institutions, the conference arrives at a pivotal moment, as Canada strengthens its commitment to open science through new mandates, platforms, and services. Taking place in Montreal on October 9-10, 2025, the event will convene 150–200 participants from government, academia, and research organizations. Together, they will develop practical guidelines and forge partnerships to transform the way research is conducted and shared nationwide. Participants will engage in hands-on work to map the current open-science landscape in Canada, and outline future directions. The program will include keynote and invited talks, panel discussions, working groups, and ample opportunities for networking and for participants to share their work. Join us as a speaker! We welcome submissions for posters, booths, and lightning talks that showcase your work in advancing open science.

## Call for posters, booths, and lightning talks

The conference offers three dynamic formats to showcase your work, spark connections, and grow your network: *posters*, *booths*, and *lightning talks*. We welcome a wide range of voices and innovations from across the open science and scholarship communities, and presentations are invited in both English and French. We strongly encourage submissions from individuals of all backgrounds, career stages, and institutions.

### Which format is right for me? 

The presentation formats are thoughtfully designed to support diverse styles of engagement, ensuring an inclusive and flexible experience for all participants.

- **Posters** (Day 1, October 9) offer an ideal format for visually presenting your research, projects, or programs. They create a relaxed setting for meaningful, one-on-one conversations, encouraging focused discussions and the exchange of ideas and insights.
- **Booths** (Day 1, October 9) are designated areas intended to showcase a project, product (such as a tool or platform), or broader initiative, and can support hands-on experiences. They are ideal for live demonstrations, interactive displays, and one-on-one conversations. Presenters will have access to rectangular tables and chairs. Power outlets, poster boards, and wooden easels can be made available on request. Presenters are welcome to bring additional materials such as signage, handouts, or stickers, and we will work with each team to accommodate specific needs. The session will run for two hours, and while presenters are not required to remain at their booth for the entire time, we encourage having someone present during key moments to engage with attendees.
- **Lightning talks** (Days 1 and 2, October 9–10) offer a fast-paced format for sharing key insights, innovative ideas, and practical solutions. These 5-minute presentations, followed by 2 minutes of Q&A, provide a lively platform to spark discussion and spotlight the most compelling aspects of your work in a dynamic and engaging way.

### How do I submit my proposal? 

We welcome submissions from organizations, researchers, and professionals at all career stages. Whether you are proposing a poster, a booth, or a lightning talk, please submit an abstract of **up to 250 words** through our online form and indicate your preferred presentation format(s). Your abstract should include a clear, concise title, be fully self-contained, and not include bibliographic references. All submissions will be reviewed by the organizing committee, and decisions will be communicated no later than July 30.
